# Introduction
This is the third course of the Coursera Data Science Specialization, **Getting and Cleaning Data**. This course focuses on collecting and cleaning data for downstream analysis and sharing.

# Course Description
Before you can work with data you have to get some. This course will cover the basic ways that data can be obtained. The course will cover obtaining data from the web, from APIs, and from colleagues in various formats including raw text files, binary files, and databases. It will also cover the basics of data cleaning and how to make data tidy. Tidy data dramatically speed downstream data analysis tasks. The course will also cover the components of a complete data set including raw data, processing instructions, codebooks, and processed data. The course will cover the basics needed for collecting, cleaning, and sharing data.

# Contents

# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Data Zip File Location: [UC Irvine Repo](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip "Clicking will download the data")

## Goal of the Project
1. A tidy data set 
2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis 
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. Analysis R Script
